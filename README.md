# About

There occur in nature about 300 nuclei, representing isotopes of
elements containing from one to at most 94 protons. Some 2200
nuclei have been made artificially during the past 70 years. The
artificial, heavy and superheavy elements, synthesized in
scientific laboratories, have at present a mass numbers starting
up to Z=116.
Ds (experimentally were observed nuclei with proton number up to 116, but there no an official name for these elements).
