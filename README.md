# About

There occur in nature about 300 nuclei, representing isotopes of
elements containing from one to at most 94 protons. Some 2200
nuclei have been made artificially during the past 70 years. The
artificial, heavy and superheavy elements, synthesized in
scientific laboratories, have at present a mass numbers starting
up to Z=116.
Ds (experimentally were observed nuclei with proton number up to 116, but there no an official name for these elements).

#An importance of shell effects.

Nuclear fission prompted Niels Bohr and John Wheeler to propose
the liquid-drop model, which treats the nucleus as a drop
of charged liquid without any structure. As long as the surface
tension in the drop is larger than the repulsive Coulomb force due
to the protons, a potential barrier prevents it from splitting.
However, this fission barrier can be overcome if we supply enough
energy to the nucleus or if the nucleus "tunnels" through the
barrier.

According to Bohr and Wheeler, the potential barrier disappears
completely when the atomic number reaches about 106. The lifetimes
of the first "transuranium" elements - such as plutonium, curium
and californium - were very close to the values predicted by the
liquid-drop model. In 1962, however, it was found that many
isotopes of transuranium elements which have a very low excitation
energy undergo spontaneous fission in just $10^{-10}-10^{-2}$ s.
This is inconsistent with the liquid-drop model predictions.
Furthermore, the model could not account for considerable
variations in the spontaneous-fission half-lives of these
"isomers".

Researchers soon realized that the probability of spontaneous
fission depends on the internal structure of the nucleus. It was
well known, for example, that the total nuclear binding energies
measured in experiments deviated from the predictions of the
liquid-drop model in a regular way. The binding energies were
highest for specific numbers of protons, Z = 2, 8, 20, 28, 50,
82, and neutrons, N = 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, 126. These "magic"
numbers of protons and neutrons are called closed shells, and are
similar to the electron shells of atomic physics.

By the end of the 1960s these observations led to a new
microscopic theory of the nucleus, which showed that closed shells
of protons and neutrons allow nuclei to be stable beyond the
limits defined by the liquid-drop model (i.e. for atomic numbers
greater than 106). Initially, there were the studies of spherical
nuclei surrounding the expected doubly
magic nucleus with Z=114 protons and N=184 neutrons. Indeed, the lifetimes of superheavy nuclei in
the $N$ = 184 region are predicted to be up to 30 orders of
magnitude longer than they would be in the absence of shells.
Later, the analysis of half-lives has shown that also deformed
superheavy nuclei, situated around the nucleus with Z=108 and
$N$=162, may have long enough lifetimes to be observed.

The shell effect was predicted to be particularly strong for
nuclei with magic numbers Z = 108 and N = 162, and even
stronger for nuclei with Z = 114 and N = 184
- which is why these regions came to be known as "islands of
stability".

Stability of these SHE is closely connected with their shell
structure. Significance of the shell effects is fundamental, since
many of them would not exist without these effects.

This is because the potential energy calculated within the
macroscopic model without any shell effects, forms a very small
barrier or even no barrier at all for heaviest nuclei, but the
fact of taking into account the shell structure of these nuclei,
increases with not too large increase of elongation of a nucleus
leading to the enlargement or even creation of the potential
energy barrier.

This theoretical model includes shell effects and gives a shell
correction to the macroscopic energy of a nucleus calculated
within liquid-drop model. Our calculations are done within such a
model, called macroscopic-microscopic approach, used by many
people for a long time.


#Directions of the studies of SHE

The focus of superheavy element research can be divided into
synthesis of new elements and new isotopes of elements in
transuranium and transfermium regions, spectroscopy of known
isotopes in these regions plus improving the data for the known
ones and investigation of reaction mechanism around the closed
proton and neutron shells.

Intensive experimental studies of SHE cause a fast increase of
spectroscopic data for nuclei from these region. The data comes almost exclusively from
measurements of alpha-particle energies appearing in
alpha-decay chains, mainly of odd-A nuclei.
Gamma-spectroscopic studies, which are also intensive in recent
years, are done for lighter nuclei (up to rutherfordium, Z=104) and only approach
presently the region of superheavy nuclei. So, the theoretical
predictions would be very helpful for an experimental
identification of the excited states and their quantum
characteristics.

For the identification of new nuclides undergoing alpha-decay,
a method for the investigation of consistent alpha-decays, the
so-called alpha-alpha correlation analysis, has been
employed since mid-60ties. This method is based on the fact that a
decay chain starting from unknown isotopes should be ended in the
known region of isotopes with the known decay properties. 
One observes alpha-particles, their kinetic
energies, half-lives of all nuclei in alpha-decay chain of
synthesized nucleus and spontaneous fission residues of known
nucleus.

There is a close connection of alpha-spectroscopy with
gamma-spectroscopy: using the information about excited states
(their energies and quantum characteristics) of a superheavy
nucleus, one can estimate the probabilities of alpha-transition to
the excited states of daughter nuclei and compare them to the
probability of gamma-transitions to the states in the parent
nuclei. In such a way it is possible to interpret an experimental
data from alpha-decay chains.


In present paper theoretical calculations of one-quasiparticle
excitations of odd-$A$ nuclei were done. Also were done the
systematics for neutron-odd and proton-odd nuclei. Alpha-decay
chain of Darmstatium 271 was plotted with taking into
account single-particle structure of decaying odd-A nuclei. In
this analysis, we mainly concentrate on deformed superheavy
nuclei. Many results are given, however, for a wider region of
nuclei to see the boundaries of this region and also to see the
behaviour of nuclear properties, when one moves across these
boundaries and outside of them.

Besides the theoretical interpretation and prediction of
spectroscopic data, there has been proposed an empirical
five-parameter formula for alpha-decay half-live. For even-even
nuclei were used three parameters and two parameters, which
include averaged effects of transitions from excited states to
excited states, were added for odd-A group of superheavy nuclei.
An important thing is that there are no adjustable parameters for
odd-odd nuclei in the formula.
